# Reference Design for Active and Passive Filters

During my PhD I hae to deal with a lot of noise from othr equipments in the clean room or 
from the biulding power lines. As the signal was either getting amplified with an active 
op amp or a lock-in amplifer the lowest possible noise level is favorable. I am not an 
elecgronic engineer at all but I tried to get by with the help of friends and THE internet. 
I just want to share them here in case someone finds them useful. They are all mostly 
centered around 4 or 10 MHz due to my use case.
